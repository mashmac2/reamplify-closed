<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>This used to be the website of Reamplify Design. Reamplify
Design was a little web company run by Mike and Alicia Henry which
built websites for small businesses and provided other website-related
services (hosting, maintenance, social media management, email
marketing, etc). It closed in 2015.
</p><p>
Mike and Alicia are now both employed at <a href="http://automattic.com">Automattic</a>, makers of
WordPress.com - try using WordPress.com for your next project! You can
still contact Mike at <a href="mailto:mike@reamplify.com">mike@reamplify.com</a>, and Alicia at
<a href="mailto:alicia@reamplify.com">alicia@reamplify.com</a>, although they are not available for client work
at this time.

Thanks! <br />Mike and Alicia Henry
